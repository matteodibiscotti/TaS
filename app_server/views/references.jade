				h1 Architecture and design choices
				p
					| Our page uses the MVC architecture.
					| 
				p
					| We made a decision not to use Angular, as it would require a considerable amount
					| of refactoring of our existing code.
				
				
				h1 Difficulties faced
				p
					| One challenge faced was the lack of familiarity with all the technologies
					| involved in the second part of the project. This made it very difficult to
					| debug, as some errors, such as incorrectly indented jade, were difficult
					| to identify.
				p
					| Another difficulty faced was with the implementation of a javascript clock
					| that tracked the current time in the footer. Although we found that this worked perfectly
					| for the first part of our projects, we had problems getting this to work in Part 2,
					| which we suspect was due to the different architecture of the project, and also the
					| use of the bootstrap framework for the first time.
